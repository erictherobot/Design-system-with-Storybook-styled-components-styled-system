# Welcome to Storybook

This is a UI component dev environment for your app.

Storybook Design System is a reusable component library that helps Storybook contributors build UIs faster.
The goal is to make building durable UIs more productive and satisfying.

We've added some basic stories inside the src/stories directory.
A story is a single state of one or more UI components. You can have as many stories as you want.
(Basically a story is like a visual test case.)
